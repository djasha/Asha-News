# Bias & Credibility Ratings Methodology

## Overview

Asha News uses a comprehensive bias and credibility rating system to help users understand the perspective and reliability of news sources. Our ratings are based on established media bias research, fact-checking organizations, and academic studies.

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:** These ratings are derived from publicly available research and analysis, NOT from direct API access to research organizations. The methodology below explains our research-based approach.

## Bias Scale (-1.0 to +1.0)

### Scale Definition
- **-1.0 to -0.3**: Left-leaning bias
